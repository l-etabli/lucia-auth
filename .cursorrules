<coding_style>
- Use functional programming style over classes
- Prefer pure functions
- Use immutable data structures
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use arrow functions
- Return early to avoid nesting
- Maximum 3 parameters, use object for more
- Avoid side effects
- Use biome for formatting (and rules are in `biome.json`)
- Prefer good naming over good comments
</coding_style>

<architecture>
- Use dependency injection
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep dependencies explicit
- Use functional programming principles
- Avoid global state
- Use SOLID principles
- Keep persistence logic in repositories
- Keep business logic entities first, then usecases
</architecture>

<naming>
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use PascalCase for types
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Prefix boolean variables with 'is', 'has', 'should'
</naming>

<types>
- Prefer type over interface
- Use union types over enums
- Use strict null checks
</types>

<error_handling>
- Use descriptive error messages
- Prefer Result type over try/catch
- Handle all error cases explicitly
- Never swallow errors silently
</error_handling>

<testing>
- Write unit tests for usecases, tested against in memory repositories
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Do not use mocks, use explicit dependency injection
- Test edge cases
</testing>

<comments>
- Write comments for "why", but only if there is no other way to express the intent (always prefer good naming)
</comments>

<imports_exports>
- Use named exports over default exports
</imports_exports>

<file_structure>
- use-cases hold the the use cases, they should not depend on infrastructure (database, http, etc.)
- most business logic should be in entities, usecase should orchestrate them
- Separate business logic from infrastructure
- Use index.ts for public API
</file_structure>

<security>
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user data
- Use secure defaults
- Handle sensitive data carefully
- Never store secrets in code, or comments : use environment variables
</security>
